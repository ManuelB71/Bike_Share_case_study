## Objective
Business Task: analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Based on key findings, provide the executive team the top three recommendations to convert casual riders into members.

## Analysis
To investigate distinguishing uses of the bikes between casual riders and member riders, the following variables are available:
- rider types vs bike type (classic, electric, docked)
- rider types vs ride length (duration in seconds)
- rider types vs use in time (weekday, month, season)
- rider types vs routes (station IDs / names)

The analysis is performed in Tableau Public, a free version of the visualisation tool. The main analysis results (in worksheets) have been combined in dashboards covering the variables above. These dashboards have then been combined in a story (Tableau: '_a story is a sequence of visualizations that work together to convey information. You can create stories to tell a data narrative, provide context, demonstrate how decisions relate to outcomes, or to simply make a compelling case_').
The story is available here: [Story - Cyclistic BikeShare](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeShare_v4/Story-CyclisticBikeShare?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Results

**Work travel rides**

Casual riders appear to show a bike usage trend around work travel days (Monday to Friday) and hours (6 am-9 am / 4 pm-6 pm) that is comparable to Member riders bike usage. A Casual rider could have a monetary incentive to take on an annual membership if he/she for example travels to work every business day (back and forth), for 5 minutes per ride and 8 weeks in a year. This is also achievable if Casual riders only ride during favorable weather conditions (late Spring and early Fall). 

**Non-work travel rides**

Casual riders that periodically ride for longer than 20 mins (trend in average ride length) may be cheaper off if they use the bikes above a certain periodicity (example 1: classic bike rental > 2.5 rides per month; example 2: electric bike rental > 2 rides per month [based on Divvy pricing plans in Chicago]). 

**Weekends / Holidays rides**

Casual riders have a tendency to rent bikes more often during the weekends and around the Summer holidays. Although an annual membership may be too expensive if riders in this group do not ride above a certain threshold, they may be inclined to take on a less expensive tailored membership.
