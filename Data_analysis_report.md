## Objective
Business Task: analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Based on key findings, provide the executive team the top three recommendations to convert casual riders into members.

## Analysis
To investigate distinguishing uses of the bikes between casual riders and member riders, the following variables are available:
- rider types vs bike type (classic, electric, docked)
- rider types vs ride length (duration in seconds)
- rider types vs use in time (weekday, month, season)
- rider types vs routes (station IDs / names)
