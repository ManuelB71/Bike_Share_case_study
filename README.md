# Bike_Share_case_study
Google Data Analytics Capstone case study

## INTRODUCTION
Cyclistic, a fictitious bike-share company in Chicago, believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. To design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members, the marketing analyst team (which you are part of) needs to understand how the use of Cyclistic bikes differs between casual riders and annual members.

The case study will follow the data analysis process steps: *Ask*, *Prepare*, *Process*, *Analyze*, *Share*, and *Act*  

## ASK
The director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, she believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members with a dedicated marketing strategy. To guide the design of the marketing campaign, the marketing analyst team needs to understand 1) how annual members and casual riders differ, 2) why casual riders would buy a membership, and 3) how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. You are tasked to answer the first question.

### *Business Task*: 
Analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Based on key findings, provide the executive team the top three recommendations to convert casual riders into members.

## PREPARE
The datasets are made available by a link to a dedicated repository with Cyclistic’s historical trip data. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).) Limitation: due to data-privacy considerations, lack of personally identifiable information prevents analysis related to the place of residence or purchase history of riders.
